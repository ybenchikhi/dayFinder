# dayFinder
This Java program calculates the day of the week for a given date entered by the user. The program prompts the user to enter a date in the format MM/dd/yyyy and then uses the SimpleDateFormat and Calendar classes to determine the day of the week.

The program outputs the day of the week in string format (e.g. Monday, Tuesday, etc.). If an invalid date format is entered, the program outputs an error message.

To use the program, simply run the DayOfWeek class in a Java environment and follow the prompts to enter a date.
